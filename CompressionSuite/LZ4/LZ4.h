/*
LZ4_compressCtx :
	This function allows to handle explicitly the CTX memory structure.
	It avoids allocating/deallocating this memory at each call, for better performance.

	On first call : provide a *ctx=NULL; It will be automatically allocated.
	On next calls : reuse the same ctx pointer.
	Use different pointers for different threads when doing multi-threading.
